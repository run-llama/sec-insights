# SEC Insights 🏦
SEC Insights uses the Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) capabilities of [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) to answer questions about SEC 10-K & 10-Q documents.

You can start using the application now at [secinsights.ai](https://www.secinsights.ai/)

## Why did we make this? 🤔
As RAG applications look to move increasingly from prototype to production, we thought our developer community would find it valuable to have a complete example of a working real world RAG application.

SEC Insights works as well locally as it does in the cloud. It also comes with many product features that will be immediately applicable to most RAG applications.

Use this repository as a reference when building out your own RAG application or fork it entirely to start your project off with a solid foundation.
